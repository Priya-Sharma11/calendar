A simple event calendar application built with React.js and Vite. The app allows users to view, add, and manage events on a calendar. The events can be displayed on specific days, and users can see details of the events through a side panel.

## Features

- **Calendar View**: A monthly calendar view that displays dates with events.
- **Event Management**: Users can add events by selecting a date and providing details such as the event name, description, and time.
- **Event Display**: All events for a selected day are shown in a side panel when a date is clicked.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that provides a faster development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app.
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state and lifecycle events.

## Instructions to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name

3. Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
